# FastBogoSort

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort)

This implementation of BogoSort uses goroutines to maximize speed,
memory usage, and CPU usage. It is recommended to run this in an
auto-scaling cloud instance to maximize cost as well. Alternatively, if you
want to be the hero developer. Import this package aliased as something like
`QuickSort`, wait a few weeks, then swap it out for a faster sorting algorithm.
